        <!-- Project description -->
        <p class="text-center">
            This site is a hypothetical web application created as a term project for the lecture 
            "Web Development/Web-Technologies" at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau.
            It is designed to showcase reproductions of famous art classics and provide a platform for users 
            to explore and interact with artworks, artists, and reviews. The site is not intended for commercial use 
            but serves as an educational project to demonstrate the implementation of a non-trivial web application.
        </p>
